The construct <code>implicit def</code> allows you to implicitly convert from one type to another.
</p>

<p>
The syntax is pretty straightforward:
</p>
<pre>implicit def [NAME](input: INPUT_TYPE): OUTPUT_TYPE = ???
</pre>
<p>
It is usually named either <code>from[INPUT_TYPE]To[OUTPUT_TYPE]</code> or in our case since it is already contained inside of the <i>companion object</i>, simply <code>to[OUTPUT_TYPE]</code>.
</p>

<p>
You have to be careful however. You can trap yourself. 
</p>

<p>
For instance, if by mistake you are passing the name of the user in the id field, in a normal situation, the compiler would break and tell you that you are giving a <code>String</code> when the method expect an <code>Int</code> and that will catch your mistake. 
</p>
<p>However, letâ€™s say you want to make your life easier for a different use case, you implement an <i>implicit conversion</i> that automatically convert <code>String</code> to <code>Int</code>. At this point, the compiler will automatically convert any <code>String</code> to <code>Int</code> which can create a real mess.
</p>

<p>
I would suggest to use <code>implicit def</code> extremely carefully and in very limited scope. Also, do not implement <i>implicit conversion</i> for basic types such as <code>String</code> or <code>Int</code>, but only for more complex types like <code>trait</code> or <code>case class</code>. So that you have a more refined control on when it is used.
