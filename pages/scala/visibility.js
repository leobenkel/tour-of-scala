  <p>Letâ€™s review the different kind of visibility: </p>
<p></p><ul>

<li><code>public</code>: In scala, the <code>public</code> keyword does not exist, this is the default behavior. If nothing is specified, the member of this context will be available for all to call.</li>

<li><code>private</code>: This will make the member not visible to the rest of the world (There is an exception about <code>companion object</code>, we are going to learn about it in a future SKB).</li>

<li><code>protected</code>: This was not illustrated in this exercise. It is related to <i>object oriented programming</i> and more specifically about <i>inheritance</i>. We are going to learn more about it in a later SKB.</li>

</ul><p></p>
