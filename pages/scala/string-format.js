  <p>Little break from the heavy stuff !</p>
<p>Letâ€™s see an example on how some <code>Java</code> features have been integrated in Scala. Specially about String formatting at the moment.</p>

This SKB is about formatting numbers.
</p>
<p>
In the first example, we are seeing how to add leading zeros in front of a number. That can be useful when building some UI or dashboard so the alignment is fix no matter how big the number is. Pretty useful and easy to use !
</p>

<p>
Then formatting <code>Double</code>, how to truncate the decimals as well as adding leading zeros. Play with it to get a good intuition about it.
</p>

<p>
And finally, getting closer to <code>Java</code> with <code>Locale</code> which allow you to display a number the right way based on the location. <code>Locale</code> can also be used to format dates and currencies ! Feel free to search for more information online and try to implement the code in here.
