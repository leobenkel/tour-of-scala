  <p>This SKB is going to continue our progress in the Object Oriented Programming aspect of Scala.</p>
<p><code>abstract class</code> are pretty similar to <code>trait</code> we saw before. But there are some slight differences.</p>
</>

const detailedInfoBox = <>
  <p>
You recognize the same keywords we learned about when we learned about <code>trait</code>. You can see <code>extends</code>, <code>protected</code> and <code>override</code>.
</p>

<p>
There are more differences but for the moment letâ€™s go one step at a time.
</p>
<p>
The main difference you can notice compare to <code>trait</code> is that you are able to have a constructor directly when you <code>extends</code> the <code>abstract class</code>. This is pretty convenient to build simple pattern. We are going to see more about this in the context of <code>enumeration</code>.
</p>
<p>
To practice the concepts of Object Oriented Programming, Try to access the fields of <code>Shape</code> in the child classes. You notice that only <code>lengthOfSides</code> is <code>protected</code> and not the other ones. Remember <code>class</code> ? By default fields are <code>private</code> in a <code>class</code>. Try to add methods, maybe the area ?
