I want to introduce you slowly to more complex problems. This one is still fun, as you know, the main topic is <code>flatMap</code> but you are going to get an intuition for a little more.</p>

<p>Enjoy the ride.

Did you get <code>flatMap</code> ? It is <code>map</code> followed by <code>flatten</code>. Try to replace the <code>flatMap</code> in the code above by <code>map</code> and add <code>flatten</code> after it.
</p>
<p>
Ok, now that the topic of todayâ€™s episode is done. What is the wizardry with all the <code>case</code> ?! This is called <i>pattern matching</i>. I am sure that, right now, you have a good intuition about it, but we are going to dive more into it, soon.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!
