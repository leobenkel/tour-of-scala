  <p>Super short one today.</p>

<p>But I think it is necessary to know in case you encounter it in the wild</p>

  <p>
So yes, super short today like I said.

<p>
It is possible in Scala to have weird value name that can be sentences. Or pretty much anything for that matter. You can even try to create a value named <code>\n</code> and it works.
</p>

<p>
The syntax is straightforward, just have to start and end the name of the identifier by <code>`</code> backquote.
</p>

<p>It also works for field names in a <code>case class</code> for instance.</p>

<p>
One use case where I have this used pretty often is with <i>giter8</i>. This is a system to create project template. You can learn more on <a href="https://github.com/foundweekends/giter8" target="_blank">their GitHub</a>. In those template, user can enter any input they want so i can be useful to keep the user input inside the <code>`</code> so the rest of the template do not break.
</p>

<p>
Another use case is to be able to use reserved keyword, for instance if you would like to name your value <code>type</code> that wouldnâ€™t work, but you can name it <code>`type`</code>.
