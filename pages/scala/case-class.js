  <p>We learned about <code>class</code> in a previous SKB, today we are going to learn about <code>case class</code>. They serve the same purpose which is to provide a blueprint to create <code>object</code>s. But case class provides a lot of build-in advantages.</p>
<p>As a start, notice how the case class is being instantiated, and how the fields are being accessed.</p>

const detailedInfoBox = <>
  <p>Did you notice that we do not need <code>new</code> to create the instance of the <code>class</code>?</p>
<p>And did you notice that we do not need a function to access any of the fields?</p>
<p>In Scala, <code>case class</code> provide build-in things, letâ€™s go over them: 
</p><ul>

<li>Constructor: To instantiate an object from a case class, no need for the <code>new</code> keyword. Note that <code>class</code> will not need <code>new</code> either in Scala 3. To understand how this is done, remember the words <code>apply</code> and <code>Companion Object</code>, we are going to come back to it later.</li>

<li>Field accessors: in <code>case class</code>, the field are <code>public</code> ( we are going to talk about <code>visibility</code> later ) by default. So you can access their values without the need to a method that will return it for you.</li>

<li>And more; remember the terms <code>unapply</code>, <code>Product</code> and <code>Serialization</code> for later SKBs.</li>

</ul>
