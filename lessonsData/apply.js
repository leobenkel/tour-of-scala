  <p><code>apply</code> is a <i>magic</i> Scala method. There is no need to call <code>apply</code> explicitly to execute it. And this is part of the tool that the <code>case class</code> use.</p>
<p>This SKB might be a bit longer than previous ones.</p>
</>

const detailedInfoBox = <>
  <p>
<code>apply</code> can be called like any other method ( <code>Person.apply(...)</code> ) but it can be used without calling its name explicitely ( <code>Person(...)</code> ). And thatâ€™s it.

<p>In fact, you could implement a function yourself: </p>

<pre>val add = new Function2[Int, Int, Int] {
  def apply(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b
}

val result = add(1, 2)

assert(result == 3)
</pre>

<p>Try and copy it above in the editor.</p>

<p>You could also implement <code>if</code> yourself ! Try it by yourself before looking at Scastie.</p>
